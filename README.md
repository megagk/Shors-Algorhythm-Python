**Introduction**

Shor's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm for integer factorisation. Given a composite odd integer N (typically assumed to be not a power of a prime), it attempts to efficiently find its
nontrivial prime factors. 
Classically, factorisation takes exponential time in the number of digits of N (for large numbers), whiler
Generally utilised for crpytography to gain access to encrpyted keys.

Although, it is kinda not useful right now; it will be in future if large-scale quantum computers become practical. 
In which case it would make RSA, DSA and ECC insecure i.e., prompting the need for post-quantum crpytography.
